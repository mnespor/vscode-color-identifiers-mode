/**
 * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
 * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
 *
 * ---
 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
 *
 * ---
 * ### How to encode tokens
 *
 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
 * ```
 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
 * ```
 *
 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
 * ```
 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
 * ```
 *
 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
 * ```
 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
 * ```
 *
 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
 * ```
 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
 * ```
 *
 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
 * ```
 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
 * ```
 *
 * @see [SemanticTokensBuilder](#SemanticTokensBuilder) for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until VS Code decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
